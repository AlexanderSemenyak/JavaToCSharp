Java to C# Converter
====================

Java to C# converter, work in progress. Uses javaparser with 1.7 
support from https://github.com/before/javaparser, IKVM.NET to 
convert the javaparser .jar into a .NET .dll, and the Roslyn CTP
for C# AST generation. 

This was a quick hack only, it is still very much a work in progress.
Pull requests and issue submission welcome.

Getting Started
===============

Clone the repo, build, and launch the Gui WPF app. Click the "..." button on
the left side to load a Java file, and then click Convert to convert to
C# on the right side. Please note that conversion may take up to a few
minutes on large files.

Alternatively, launch the command line (Cli) version to process files
from the command line.
